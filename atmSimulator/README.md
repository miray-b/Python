# 🏦 Python ATM Simulation

This is a command-line interface (CLI) application developed to practice fundamental Python concepts. It simulates basic banking operations with a focus on logic control and error handling.

## 🚀 Features
* **Check Balance:** View real-time account status.
* **Deposit Funds:** Add money to the account (includes input validation to prevent negative values).
* **Withdraw Funds:** Withdraw money with safety checks for insufficient funds and invalid inputs.
* **User Experience:** Clean menu design and simulated processing delays using the `time` library for a realistic feel.
* **Error Handling:** Robust `try-except` blocks ensure the program doesn't crash when invalid data (like text) is entered.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3
* **Key Concepts:** Loops (`while`), Conditional Logic (`if-else`), Error Handling (`try-except`)

## 💻 How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
python atmSimulator.py
```
